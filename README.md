# 30Days-DSA-Challenge (Zero to Hero)

Welcome to the **30Days-DSA-Challenge (Zero to Hero)**! This repository contains a structured 30-day plan to master Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) by solving ~150‚Äì160 problems, taking you from beginner to interview-ready. Whether you're preparing for coding interviews or aiming to strengthen your problem-solving skills, this challenge is your path to becoming a DSA Hero!

## üöÄ Why Take This Challenge?
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Tackle key DSA topics like Arrays, Strings, Linked Lists, Trees, Graphs, Dynamic Programming, and more.
- **Structured Learning**: Follow a 30-day plan with 5‚Äì6 problems daily, progressing from easy to medium (and some hard) problems.
- **Interview-Ready**: Master patterns and techniques commonly tested at top tech companies (FAANG, startups, etc.).
- **Community & Growth**: Share your progress on [X](https://x.com) with `#30DaysDSAChallenge` and join a community of learners!

## üìÖ Challenge Overview
The challenge spans **30 days**, covering ~150‚Äì160 problems across 10 core DSA topics. Each day focuses on specific concepts, with problems sourced from platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, and GeeksforGeeks. The final days include mock interviews and revision to solidify your skills.

| **25‚Äì27** | Dynamic Programming | 15 | 0/1 Knapsack, Longest Common Subsequence, Edit Distance |
| **28‚Äì30** | Mock Interviews & Revision | 10 | Random problems, focus on explanation and optimization |

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Use This Repository
1. **Clone the Repo**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kshitij-parad/30Days-DSA-Challenge-ZeroToHero.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to Folders**: Each day/topic has its own folder (e.g., `Day1-3_Arrays`, `Day4-6_Strings`) containing:
   - Problem descriptions
   - Solutions (in Python/C++/Java, etc.)
   - Time and space complexity analysis
   - Edge case explanations
3. **Solve Daily**: Aim for 5‚Äì6 problems per day. Start with easy problems, then tackle medium/hard ones.
4. **Track Progress**: Use a spreadsheet or platform like LeetCode to mark completed problems.
5. **Revise & Reflect**: Revisit tough problems (e.g., DP, Graphs) weekly and use Days 28‚Äì30 for mock interviews.
6. **Contribute**: Add your solutions or optimizations by submitting a pull request!

## üìù Tips for Success
- **Understand, Don‚Äôt Memorize**: Focus on *why* a solution works (e.g., why Kadane‚Äôs uses a running sum).
- **Analyze Complexity**: For each solution, note time and space complexity (e.g., O(n), O(log n)).
- **Handle Edge Cases**: Test your code with boundary inputs (e.g., empty arrays, single nodes).
- **Practice Mock Interviews**: Use platforms like Pramp or Interviewing.io to simulate real interviews.
- **Stay Consistent**: Even if you miss a day, resume quickly to maintain momentum.
- **Join the Community**: Share your progress on [X](https://x.com) with `#30DaysDSAChallenge` for support and feedback.
